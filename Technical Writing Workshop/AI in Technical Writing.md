​Good ways to use AI and bad ways to use AI.

## ​The bad:
*These are things to avoid:*
* ​"Whitewashed voice" - https://www.youtube.com/shorts/3WL30Vxcu5o
* ​Formulaic and robotic
* ​Neurotically positive and thoughtful - everything is "great," "exciting," "important"
* ​Everything for beginners
* ​Bloat! "AI Slop"
* first drafts
* Voice

### Why is this bad?
Explain why people don't like this. (Even better, prove it!)
- People can talk to AI themselves. Why should they read _your_ conversation with it?
- They want your thinking, your voice. That's the value.

 

> _Exercise idea:_ Show paragraph written with AI assistance. Redline it, to show problems.

## ​The good:
*Great things to use AI for.*
* ​outlining
* ​Summarizing good info
* ​Editor (review)
* ​Create contrast (ex: pretend you disagree with me, what would you say...)
* ​Ask for options, and select the best ones


## ​Methods:
*This is "how" you should use AI for writing.*
* ​Invest in infrastructure - so your style, voice, and methods are replicated
* ​Always revise - switch off drafts between you and AI
* ​Volume isn't always useful
* AI can't always access your content - set it up in the repo.

​
## ​The real question:
​People can talk to AI themselves. Why should they read your conversation with it?

​They want your thinking, your voice. That's the value.

## **Hands-on Activity (15 min)**

- Take a piece, identify what's "you" vs. what AI could do

# Division of Labor: Human vs. AI

## 1. **What you own (non-negotiable):**
- The claim / thesis / point of view
- Voice and tone decisions
- What to include vs. cut (editorial judgment)
- Structural choices (narrative vs. informational mode)
- The "so what" — why this matters

## 2. **What AI can do (supervised):**
- Generate raw material you'll reshape
- Find gaps in your logic ("what am I missing?")
- Compress verbose drafts
- Produce variations ("give me 5 ways to open this")
- Research summaries you'll verify
- Rubber duck debugging your argument


### Practical Example: Writing a Technical Blog Post

| Phase                   | Human                                                 | AI                                                                                     |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Concept**          | Decide the claim: "dbt packages reduced our code 99%" | —                                                                                      |
| **2. Outline**          | Sketch structure (3 min)                              | Expand bullet points, suggest missing sections                                         |
| 2b. Outline + Objective | Choose different objectives.                          | Modify outline to match objectives. (Will need good comparable examples to draw from.) |
| **3. Draft**            | Write the intro and key insight paragraphs            | Fill in routine explanations, boilerplate setup steps                                  |
| **4. Review**           | Read AI sections, flag what sounds wrong              | "What counterarguments exist?" / "Where am I unclear?"                                 |
| **5. Rewrite**          | Rewrite AI sections in your voice                     | —                                                                                      |
| **6. Edit**             | Final judgment on cuts                                | "Cut this by 30%" then you accept/reject                                               |

**The test:** Could a reader tell which parts were AI-assisted? If yes, you're not done.

## AI Writing Behaviors to Avoid (Expanded)

### Voice Problems

|Pattern|Example|Why it fails|
|---|---|---|
|**Sycophantic openers**|"That's a great question!" / "Absolutely!"|Reader isn't asking you to validate them|
|**Hedge stacking**|"It's important to note that it may be worth considering..."|Says nothing, burns trust|
|**Neurotically positive**|Everything is "exciting," "powerful," "game-changing"|No credibility, no contrast|
|**False enthusiasm**|"Let's dive in!" / "Let's explore!"|Filler energy, no substance|

### Structure Problems

| Pattern                      | Example                                                     | Why it fails                          |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Throat-clearing intros**   | "In today's fast-paced world of data engineering..."        | Delays the point, reader skips anyway |
| **Everything for beginners** | Explaining what an API is in an advanced integration post   | Wrong audience assumption, bloat      |
| **Compulsive completeness**  | Listing every edge case, every caveat                       | Buries the signal in noise            |
| **Symmetric false balance**  | "On one hand... on the other hand... ultimately it depends" | Avoids taking a position              |

### Detail Problems

|Pattern|Example|Why it fails|
|---|---|---|
|**Redundant pairs**|"each and every," "first and foremost"|Empty calories|
|**Explaining the obvious**|"This is important because it matters for your workflow"|Circular, adds nothing|
|**Defensive citations**|Supporting claims no one disputes|Wastes reader attention|
|**List bloat**|10 items when 3 make the point|Dilutes impact|

### The Meta-Problem

AI writes to _avoid being wrong_. You should write to _be useful_.

AI hedges because confidence is risky. Good technical writing takes positions.

**Possible exercise:** Show a paragraph with 3-4 of these patterns. Have them rewrite it in 60 seconds. Compare results.
