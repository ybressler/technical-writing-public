Good ways to use AI and bad ways.

​The bad:
* ​"Whitewashed voice" - https://www.youtube.com/shorts/3WL30Vxcu5o
* ​Formulaic and robotic
* ​Neurotically positive and thoughtful - everything is "great," "exciting," "important"
* ​Everything for beginners
* ​Bloat! "AI Slop"

​The good:
* ​outlining
* ​Summarizing good info
* ​Editor (review)
* ​Create contrast (ex: pretend you disagree with me, what would you say...)
* ​Ask for options, and select the best ones

​Methods:
* ​Invest in infrastructure - so your style, voice, and methods are replicated
* ​Always revise - switch off drafts between you and AI
* ​Volume isn't always useful
* ​AI can't always access your content - set it up in the repo.

​

## ​The real question:

​People can talk to AI themselves. Why should they read your conversation with it?
​They want your thinking, your voice. That's the value.
